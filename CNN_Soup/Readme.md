# A Soup Starter

* Believe it or not, CNN's website for **1996: Year in Review** is still alive on the web: <http://edition.cnn.com/EVENTS/1996/year.in.review/>

* We have, however, stored the HTML document as a string in your starter file.

* Your task, should you accept it (and you should), is to use Beautiful Soup to scrape and print the following pieces of information:

1. The **title**

2. All **paragraph** texts

3. The top 10 headlines (warning: this one is a bit tricky, and may not come out perfectly!)
